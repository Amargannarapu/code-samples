## Reusable PnP React control: TreeView (spfx-react-treeview-control)

This graphical control allows presenting a hierarchical view of information. Each tree item can have a number of subitems. This is often visualized by an indentation in a list. A tree item can be expanded to reveal subitems (if exist), and collapsed to hide subitems.

### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
npm i
npm i -g gulp
gulp
```

This package produces the following:

* lib/* - intermediate-stage commonjs build artifacts
* dist/* - the bundled script, along with other resources
* deploy/* - all resources which should be uploaded to a CDN.
